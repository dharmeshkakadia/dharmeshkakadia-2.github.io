## Introduction to Kubernetes

Why?
I wanted an intro that I would read. Most are either too high level and focus on how to use kuberenetes without explain internals.

The other category is the set of articles which are written like target towards contributors - too much detailed. 

So, I wanted something in between - not completely dumb, but also not throwing kitchensink of jargans - and this is that attempt. I might fail, but its my attempt, so I can.
