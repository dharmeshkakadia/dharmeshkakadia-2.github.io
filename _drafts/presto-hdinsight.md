# What is Presto?

It supports querying data in wide range of format including Parquet, ORC, Text, RCFile and so on.

# Presto Architecture
To understand how does presto works, lets looks at the presto architecture. The below figures are taken from presto website and facebook presentations.

Each connector implements two APIs 
1. Metadata API
2. Data streaming API

# Currently avilable connectors

Some of the popular examples of [connectors](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector.html) include [Kafka](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/kafka.html), [Cassandra](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/cassandra.html), [Hive](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/hive.html), [Accumulo](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/accumulo.html), [MongoDB](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/mongodb.html), [MySQL](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/mysql.html), [PostegreSQL](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/postgresql.html), [Redis](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/redis.html) and so on.

The HDInsight script only confgiures hive and [TPCH](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/tpch.html) connetors by default. If you want to add other conenctors, following the instructions below.

# Use cases
While presto is very successfully used by nuber of orgnizations for their fast data anlysis needs,
One of the prime aspect that caught my attention was the ability to query various data sources in a single query. This is so magical âœ¨, let me give you an example,


This obviates the need to bring the all the data manged under the same system. This in my opinion is so important since, the world where each system wants to be the _only_ system to store and process data.
The reality however is that each system makes different tradeoffs and are fit and serve only part of the larger picture.

Presto supprts wide range of [inbuilt and user defined functions](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions.html)

The SQL syntax should make you feel home.
