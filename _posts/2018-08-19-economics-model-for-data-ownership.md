# Paper 

We will mainly focus on discussing a recent paper ["Nonrivalry and the Economics of Data"](http://christophertonetti.com/files/papers/JonesTonetti_DataNonrivalry.pdf) by Prof. Charles Jones and Prof. I.  Christopher Tonetti (#TODO links?). At 40 pages, this is quite a long paper with some greeks.

They show that there are large social gains from letting users own and sell their own data.

They discuss the concept of nonriverly. Here is the first line in the abstract 
> Data is nonrival: a personâ€™s location history, medical records, and driving data
can be used by any number of firms simultaneously without being depleted.

and 
another 
> giving the data property rights to consumers can generate allocations that are close to optimal. Consumers appropriately balance their concerns for privacy against the economic gains that come from selling data to all interested parties.


Just like [ideas](http://dharmeshkakadia.github.io/ideas-hard/), data is not depleted through usage. Unlike other goods, 

Currently most markets/companies are treating data as a rival good - hence the race to acquire the datasets and keeping them private. This stifles innovation and there is already enough written about how FANG has advantage thanks to the datasets they have accumulated over the years. 


>Not only is an economy without data sharing poorer in the long run, but this policy
actually reduces long-run growth in income per person

Paper also discusses similarity and differences between data and idea - both of which are non-rival goods.

They also show that its in firms best interest to limit the sharing of data outside the firm.

Interestingly this is the first time I am seeing a definition of an Idea 
> An idea is a piece of information that is a set of instructions for making an economic good, which may include other ideas. 

And then they define "data as remaining forms of information". I am not sure I fully agree with this definition, but lets keep going.

> An idea is a production function whereas data is a factor of production. 



I saw this paper first in the [tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/hal2001/status/1029814266247958529) by Hart Lambur.
