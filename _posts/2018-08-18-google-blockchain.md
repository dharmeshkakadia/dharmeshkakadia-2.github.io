title: Google for the next internet
---

What is next internet?
Why do you think it needs google? 
What does it look like?
How does it differ from Google? Just because I have used Google as a search engine for the current world, there can be confusion that I am talking about similar concepts. I am talking about similar problem in a different space with a very different solution.

Why do you think micro-payment or subsciption will work?

What does subscription model for blockchains look like?

# Philosophy

There are some striking differences from web2 : Web2 companies (Google/FB etc) built closed databases from open web. Web 3 companies can/will build open databases from open web. In that processes there are multiple intermediaries, with misaligned interests. The opportunity that web3 provides is to align these incentives. This is of course not guaranteed, but possible and the incentives will be open for everyone to examine.

# Problem 
The blockchain has opened the data of the web. As it grows the problem will be two fold :
People want to find information across different blockchains. Different blockchains in this regard are sort of like different intranets. 
Businesses want to reach out the audience who are interested in particular information.

```
        .__            __          
__  _  _|  |__ _____ _/  |_________
\ \/ \/ /  |  \\__  \\   __\___   /
 \     /|   Y  \/ __ \|  |  /    / 
  \/\_/ |___|  (____  /__| /_____ \
             \/     \/           \/
```

For the traditional web, Google mediated this relationship by indexing the web and make it accessible.

> Search = Index + AI

For the decentralized web, we are building something similar.
Google built this relationship as an advertisement business, while on blockchains, we have to come up with a newer model. I am not connived that the paying tokens is a great way forward.
Google's promise is we index the web so you can ask for information or you can ask to reach to customers. They operate the complex infrastructure of indexing the web, os that you don't have to. If decentralized web is to reach is full potential, we need a lot more developers/non-tech people to be using this information to generate economic activity. This is one step to make that easier. The other steps are payment systems - which there is a lot of focus on - and are useful. Also, from the customer acquisition point of view, 21 was a good attempt - but it was the yahoo approach of doing things - mailing list or email - sort of like yahoo. More of a fulfilling the niche than mainstream. My ideas is to create mainstream accessibility of the blockchain data. This is a good line.
Traditional businesses know where to go for customer acquisition - facebook, google, insta and so on. How do you solve that problem for the new world.
Defining the correct API is going to be the most important challenge.
If you define it too narrowly - make it chain specific its much less useful.
There are not enough use cases *right now* to define it broadly. And thats the opportunity - you will naturally grow with the growth of the market. Module the risk on only 2–3 players winning and controlling/collecting all the data.
Also, in terms of efficiency we don't need super latest data. There is a tradeoff between the speed and scale. For most non-crypto, non-financial use cases the latency might be ok.
Also, will have to figure out how the more data can help as it grows - I am not certain it would be the case - but it would be good to have an angle into that.
What are some example of the questions people might be interested in ?
The flat fees makes sense for most real world businesses, while the token is how the blockchains are going to be charging. So not an easy thing to balance.
All this different sites are basically privately owned databases - free to crawl - and google did that and made it accessible to everyone. We can do that same for blockchain. The different chains are great - like there is amazon for shopping, twitter for public debates, and so on - but without a central way to reach to them its going to hard to get the mainstream adoption.

# Contrarian arguments 

One can argue that there will be only few chains that would win - and so we don't/won't have the discovery problem. May be. Its more like curation at that point. This is similar in spirit that you don't go to google when shopping, but directly to the amazon.
There are no good use cases - other than tracking the financial data on different chain - how is this coin doing and so on. May be the good use case would be for actual real world usage - show me the package shipping information on the IBM blockchain. Show me the X from Y chain.

# Private 

Technically could be a challenge - this is actually good. It means it would be a harder to compete.

[8:37 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: I am looking at little broader where you can be person to things (Shopping in amazon for example is a person to thing vs the Etsy would be person to person)
How do you discover where to look for logo designers ?
I am looking at the discovery probem 
Many blockchain usecases/projects are considering a walled garden. Here is an example : I will create a crypto market place for providing services. Great. Say I need a service from a logo designer, how do I find one? Oh very simple. "You come to the platform" and search for logo designer. What this is ignoring is that *Everybody* in the world would have to know that this website provides this service. 
Which in my opinion is not a great idea. 
Also, this kind of thinking might be (atleast, to a degree) a reason for not penetrating users. 
This is also not practical. For comparison, from web2, most people can name Google, Amazon, etc. May be Yelp. 
The mobile provides an interesting experiment. App stores solve this discovery problem 
Till now we have not found a good solution - as in both current solutions end up harming the users - ads and notifications.

[8:50 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: In the meantime, little more about my stuff - currently if you started a new business, you know where to go for customer acquisition - google, FB and so on. You don't need to understand the complex mechanics of how google or FB works. You can find the information/people/product/ you need with it, without knowing how the site is hosted
[8:56 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: but is doesn't exist right now. probably also early - like having google when there are 100 sites on internet does not make sense. But is indispensable when that number is 100k
[9:11 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: Tokens as a initial user acquisition story is great.
[9:11 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: But
[9:11 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: I am not sure its best for anything after the first month.






[9:22 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: My pitch would be simple - if you make it accessible to me, I begin you more traffic
[9:23 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: beneficial for both
[9:23 PM, 6/10/2018] Madhavan: So you are saying other apps could add data to this pool and help growth
[9:23 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: Yes
[9:24 PM, 6/10/2018] Madhavan: Hmm, interesting take. Especially because data is public anyway, api access makes it more streamlined
[9:24 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: Just to be clear thats an example, I have nothing to sell right now
[9:24 PM, 6/10/2018] Madhavan: I can buy that
[9:25 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: and makes it a benefit for me as adoption grows
[9:25 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: (if it does)




[9:27 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: Non-crpyto people want to find crypto resources (information/people/data). There doesn't exist a solution for it. I am building one.





You started a website for freelancers lets say where you get paid on bitcoin
[9:29 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: How do you bootstrap and/or find more users ?
[9:29 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: I am a freelancer who is trying to find more work and probably want to make more money directly - instead of giving a huge cut to the current platforms.
[9:30 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: I act as a mediator (having data about your website etc.) to drive more users to your platform
[9:31 PM, 6/10/2018] Madhavan: So you'd enable something like "give me people who invested in 0x and EOS"
[9:31 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: yes
[9:31 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: kind of
[9:32 PM, 6/10/2018] Madhavan: How do you drive users?
[9:32 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: by answer the above question
[9:32 PM, 6/10/2018] Madhavan: What information do you need from the website, what information from user?
[9:32 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: Whatever information needs to be useful for driving traffic.
[9:33 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: for all blockchains, needs their transection data, wallet addresses, and so on
[9:33 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: for platforms on top, more complicated.
[9:33 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: Each platform might have its own data - in your case the platform might expose the profile of the users and so on




[9:46 PM, 6/10/2018] Madhavan: I see HUGE value in this for ICOs. Just provide an interface to query who all invested in other ICOs and give their email Id.
Users would want to give email ids because they don't want to miss opportunities
New companies doing block chain, raising ico need email ids
[9:47 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: very limited scale
[9:47 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: 21 is essentially become that




Why not own the discovery platform?
[9:49 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: I have tons of arguments on both sides on this actually
[9:50 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: The discovery platforms are hard to monitize
[9:50 PM, 6/10/2018] Madhavan: What are the top pro and con for each?
[9:51 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: if you take out the ads (I dont believe in ads), there is no easy way to inject yourself into a transection
[9:51 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: pro is that makes it much more useful. Number of developers << Number of users
[9:52 PM, 6/10/2018] Madhavan: What about paying users? Will this still hold true?
[9:52 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: Then there are lots of implication as go down a path on either of this
[9:53 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: you mean paid register users only ?
[9:53 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: That would make it very limited. The thing I wanted is to be accessible for a lot of people. Getting people to register as a starting point is a nonstarter.
[9:54 PM, 6/10/2018] Madhavan: No, given that you don't do ads. How many users are there who would pay for the data as compared to the number of devs (who'd use your api if you go that route)
[9:54 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: I can easily do verticles.
[9:54 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: API in early days lock you down. Thats one thing I don't like.
[9:55 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: on the pro side it also locks down the layers on top on you, which is great.
[9:55 PM, 6/10/2018] Madhavan: I think I am missing something here. What is the kind of data you expose other than 'A transfered X tokens T to B'
[9:56 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: So my current inclination is somewhere between operating a free for users, but charging platforms for access
[9:56 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: which is hard sell
[9:56 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: If you think the blockchain are going to be recording more data than the finance
[9:57 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: for example, if IBM is recording data about food produce on the blockchain, users can ask a question, tell me where was these produce made and how it shipped here
[9:58 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: or if its recording the historical objects data, users can ask a question, tell me who all owned this valuable painting
[9:58 PM, 6/10/2018] Madhavan: I see. How do you crawl this data scalably?
[9:58 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: Thats not the most difficult thing technically
[9:58 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: Many of this will be freely available for crawling
[9:58 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: and storage and compute is cheap
[9:59 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: The much harder question in my mind is how you expose this data
[9:59 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: API, free text, verticles, all have tradeoffs
[10:00 PM, 6/10/2018] Madhavan: It would look like this in most situations
1. Run a node on that blockchain
2. Listen for events
3. Convert the data in the event to a standard schema
4. Expose
[10:00 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: And other way of course is right a lib that everyone integrates in their app/platform
[10:00 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: so I get it much more measly
[10:00 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: *easily
[10:01 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: yes. Not the most costly thing to do.
==
[10:08 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: Right now most of the people who give micro tasks are actually looking for a very simple answer - users who would be interested in this X crypto/ICO platform
[10:08 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: that is better answered with API
[10:08 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: instead of surveys
==
ou have this page with just one drop down of 'select blockchain'
User selects 0x
You provide a list of addresses that made the investment.
Allow the user to send a message to these addresses.
I can see all my messages sent to my address by providing a valid signature saying I own that address




[10:25 PM, 6/10/2018] Dharmesh: marketing in current world. Dev in the new world.



[10:29 PM, 6/10/2018] Madhavan: My answer to this is "people will be willing to pay for data that is publicly available in an organised way"
?





[11:57 PM, 6/26/2018] Dharmesh: My big thesis is the companies that will be big in this space in 10 years are companies that will bridge the current use cases to crypto and will invent a native way of solving it




Lets call this magic solution WhatzCo for now.
